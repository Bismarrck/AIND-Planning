### 1. STRIPS

Developed by Fikes and Nilsson^1 in 1971 at SRI International, **STRIPS** (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) is the first major automated planning system. The same name was later used to refer to the formal language of the inputs to this planner^2. 

### 2. WARPLAN

Introduced by Wardinger and Warren in 1974^3, **WARPLAN** is the first planner written in a logic programming language (Prolog). It uses promotion and chronological backtracking to solve the Sussman anomaly optimally. It contains only 100 lines of code.

### 3. A*

**A*** is one of the most widely used pathfinding and graph traversal algorithms in computer science. It was first described in 1968 by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael^4 of SRI International. **A*** is a modification of the famous Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Uniform Cost Search) but can only find paths to one location.
